Water scarcity is a lack of drinkable water available in a given area.<br>
It mostly affects arid and deserted areas, and places where the water is too polluted to drink.<br>
It is a social, environmental and economic problem in many countries. Water scarcity can be the result of both human and natural causes.<br>
Changes in climate and weather patterns can cause the availability of water to drop.<br> 
Common human causes include over-consumption, bad governance, pollution, and increases in the demand for water<br>

Different terms are used to describe different types of water scarcity:<br>
A water shortage is when there is not enough water to meet demands. Changes in the weather, such as drought can cause water shortage.<br>
Water stress is the difficulty of finding sources of fresh water for use.<br>
A water crisis is a situation where the available supply of potable, clean water within an area is less than the demand for it.<br>

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will be living in countries or regions with total water<br> scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions.<br>
The World Bank has said that climate change could heavily change the future of water availability and use, and therefore increase water stress on a global scale<br>

Water scarcity has negative affects on ecology, biodiversity, agriculture and human health.<br>
It has also led to armed conflicts in several cases.<br>
