<p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi family.[16] His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a housewife.[17] He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhavna.[18] According to his family, when he was three-years old, Kohli would pick up a cricket bat, start swinging it and ask his father to bowl at him.[19]

Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar[20] and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School. In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created, and Kohli, a nine-year-old, was part of its first intake.[20] Kohli's father took him to the academy after their neighbours suggested that "Virat shouldn't waste his time in gully cricket and instead join a professional club".[17] Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time.[20] Sharma recounts Kohli's early days at his academy, "He oozed talent. It was so difficult to keep him quiet. He was a natural in whatever he did and I was most impressed with his attitude. He was ready to bat at any spot, and I had to literally push him home after the training sessions. He just wouldnâ€™t leave."[21] In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice.[17] Apart from sports, Kohli was good at academics as well, and his teachers remember him as "a bright and alert child".[22] Kohli's family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to Gurgaon.[23]

Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month.[17] Regarding his early life, Kohli has said in an interview, "I've seen a lot in life. Losing my father at a young age, the family business not doing too well, staying in a rented place. There were tough times for the family... It's all embedded in my memory."[24] According to Kohli, his father supported his cricket training during his childhood, "My father was my biggest support. He was the one who drove me to practice every day. I miss his presence sometimes</p>
